# Task: Missing Values Cleaning

## Description
This task involves identifying and handling missing data in a large dataset using Excel Power Query.

## What I did:
1. downloaded a .csv file from kaggle and opened it in excel power query
2. identified null values and replaced it with 0 (used view in power query to identify)
3. removed duplicate rows
4. standardized the text values
5. handled all the columns into their right formats and data types
6. made all header names clean and uniform by adding a row and using the formula =SUBSTITUTE(LOWER(A1), " ", "_") then pasting it in the original header row and then deleting the added row
